# GitHub Actions for Azure Kubernetes service or any generic Kubernetes cluster

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions)  gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. 

A set of GitHub Actions for deploying to a Kubernetes cluster, including [Azure Kubernetes service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) and any generic Kubernetes cluster.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source)!

The repository contains the following GitHub Actions:
* [k8s-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/k8s-set-context): Used for setting the target K8s cluster context by providing kubeconfig or service account details
* [aks-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/aks-set-context): Used for setting the target AKS cluster context by providing Azure subscription details
* [k8s-create-secret](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/k8s-create-secret) : Create a generic secret or docker-registry secret in Kubernetes cluster.
* [K8s-deploy](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/k8s-deploy): Deploy manifest action for Kubernetes to bake and deploy manifests to a Kubernetes cluster.
* [setup-kubectl](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/setup-kubectl): Install a specific version of kubectl binary on runner

The [container-actions](https://github.com/Azure/container-actions) contains:
* [docker-login](https://github.com/Azure/container-actions/tree/master/docker-login) : Actions to [log in to a private container registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/). Once login is done, the next set of Actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.

> The docker-login Actions in this repository (k8s-actions) will be deleted in the near future. Please use the Docker Actions from [container-actions](https://github.com/Azure/container-actions).

[Azure Actions repository](https://github.com/Azure/actions) has a list of all the GitHub Actions for Azure.


# Usage

Usage information for individual actions can be found in their respective directories.

For any credential like Azure Service Principal, Kubeconfig, add them as [secrets](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

In the above example the secret name is `REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` and it can be used in the workflow by using the following syntax:

```yaml
container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
```

To use an Azure Service Principal, create a secret called AZURE_CREDENTIALS that contains: 
```json
{
"tenantId": "<yourtenantid>",
"clientId": "<yourclientid>",
"clientSecret": "<yourclientsecret>",
"subscriptionId": "<yoursubscriptionid>"
}   
```

## End to end workflow for building container images and deploying to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    
    - uses: azure/container-actions/docker-login@master
      with:
        login-server: contoso.azurecr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
    
    - run: |
        docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
      
    # Set the target AKS cluster. 
    - uses: azure/k8s-actions/aks-set-context@master
      with:
        creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
        cluster-name: contoso
        resource-group: contoso-rg
        
    - uses: azure/k8s-actions/k8s-create-secret@master
      with:
        container-registry-url: contoso.azurecr.io
        container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret

    - uses: azure/k8s-actions/k8s-deploy@master
      with:
        manifests: |

          manifests/service.yml
        images: |

        imagepullsecrets: |
          demo-k8s-secret
